I spent half that time as a Unity developer, making a VR app, a mobile game (which was evil) and an AR sales app for window blinds before moving on to Game Design, working at Auroch Digital then to Team17. I've worked on Mulitplayer arena shooters, roguelite dungeon crawlers, turn based tactics games and 2 expansions for Overcooked 2.</p>

Initially I was in charge of the progression system which I designed, modelled and iterated on. I then went on to work on weapon concepting, designing one of the maps, making the Lab Modes and working in Unreal to set up various reward and config data.</p>

On Hangry Horde I came in late in development to help out with level and mode balancing and iteration. I then worked on Carnival of Chaos producing new mechanic and theme ideas and doing most of the level design.</p>

I was on the project as a design consultant, writing reports about the game’s progress, offering mechanic advice and generally being the design department’s eyes on the project.</p>

My main contribution was the design of the mission system to try and add interesting mission gameplay that also links in with the different payloads and missions. But I also worked on the endgame design and a few other systems.</p>

Since it’s a time loop based game I put a lot of writing work into randomising the opening text so the player always has something new to read each time they entered the room.</p>

All lighting in the game is 2d volumetric and exerts a force on the player character.</p>
