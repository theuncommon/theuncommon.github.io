#Adam Carter-Groves
I'm a Game Designer with well formatted code who’s been in the games industry for 5 and a half years. I spent half that time as a Unity developer, making a VR app, a mobile game (which was evil) and an AR sales app for window blinds before moving on to Game Design, working at Auroch Digital then to Team17. I've worked on Mulitplayer arena shooters, rogulite dungeon crawlers, turn based tactics games and 2 expansions for Overcooked 2.
